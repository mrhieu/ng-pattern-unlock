Android pattern unlock
======================

## Specifications

- Do a HTML/CSS/Javascript implementation of Android like mobile pattern unlock.

- It should ask user to set up a pattern first and later unlock using the same pattern.

- Make the page mobile/touch friendly.

- You may use AngularJS for this task.

- Do not use any third party plugin/library which might provide this complete functionality out of the box.


**Some basic rules to keep in mind**

1. Code should work in multiple browsers(Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

2. Use Semantic HTML.

3. Once done with the test, mail us back the files in zip format.

## Rules
- at minimum 4 dots have to be used
- at maximum 9 dots can be used
- one dot can be used only once
- the order in which the dots are connected matters (thus making it a directed graph)
- dots are connected with a straight line meaning that all points on the path of the line get connected

## How to run
